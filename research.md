# Memory Foam & All-Foam Mattresses (Canada)  

### Endy Mattress (Original)  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium-firm (around 6.5/10 on the firmness scale) ([Douglas vs Endy Mattress Review (2025) - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-comparisons/douglas-vs-endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=Douglas%20vs%20Endy%20Mattress%20Review,support%20and%20pressure%20relief)).  
- **Mattress Type:** All-foam (proprietary open-cell polyfoam construction, similar to memory foam) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=Endy%20follows%20the%20one,Endy%20starts%20at%20%24675%2C%20which)).  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – built with open-cell foam to improve breathability (no added cooling gel layers) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=,average%20edge%20support)).  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Excellent motion isolation; the foam absorbs movement well, making it a good choice for couples ([Endy Mattress Review (2025 Update) | Mattress Clarity](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/endy-sleep/#:~:text=Motion%20Transfer)).  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Below-average edge support (common for foam mattresses); noticeable compression at the edges when sitting ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=,average%20edge%20support)).  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (Queen size is around CA$895) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=delivered%20to%20customers%20in%20a,995%2B%20CAD)). This is a mid-range, affordable bed-in-a-box option.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full/Double, Queen, King, **California King** ([Endy Mattress Review: A Comfy Choice for Canadian Sleepers](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review#:~:text=)). (All standard sizes, including Cal King.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold online through Endy’s website; also available via Sleep Country Canada (Endy is a Sleep Country-owned brand) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=Delivery%2C%20Trials%2C%20Returns%20Endy%20Shipping,days%20Sleep%20trial%20length%3A100%20nights)).  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Comfortable medium-firm feel that suits all sleep positions, good pressure relief for side sleepers, and outstanding motion isolation ([Endy Mattress Review (2025 Update) | Mattress Clarity](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/endy-sleep/#:~:text=Pros%20of%20the%20Endy%20Mattress)) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025 Update) | Mattress Clarity](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/endy-sleep/#:~:text=Motion%20Transfer)). Many appreciate its balance of support and comfort for back and combo sleepers ([Endy Mattress Review (2025 Update) | Mattress Clarity](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/endy-sleep/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20fantastic%20medium,to%20give%20Endy%20a%20shot)). **Cons:** Not ideal for stomach sleepers or those who prefer very firm beds (hips may sink too much) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025 Update) | Mattress Clarity](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/endy-sleep/#:~:text=Cons%20of%20the%20Endy%20Mattress)). Some users report **edge sagging** when sitting, and like most all-foam beds it may trap some heat ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=,average%20edge%20support)) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025 Update) | Mattress Clarity](https://www.mattressclarity.com/reviews/endy-sleep/#:~:text=Fans%20of%20very%20soft%20or,be%20the%20bed%20for%20you)).  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night risk-free trial; 15-year limited warranty (requires registration) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=%2A%20100,year%20warranty%20%28conditional%20on%20registration)). Free returns within trial period, full refund if not satisfied.  

### Douglas Original Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium-firm (approximately 6–6.7/10, a true medium-firm feel) ([Douglas Mattress Review: Our Test Lab Ratings - Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review#:~:text=Douglas%20Mattress%20Review%3A%20Our%20Test,)) ([Douglas Mattress Review 2025: Tested by Canadian Engineers](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review/#:~:text=Douglas%20Mattress%20Review%202025%3A%20Tested,Sleepers)). Only one firmness option is offered.  
- **Mattress Type:** All-foam memory foam mattress (3 layers: cooling gel foam, transitional elastex foam, high-density support foam) ([Douglas® Original Memory Foam Mattress | Canada's Best Mattress](https://www.douglas.ca/en/product/douglas-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOooj92nqjcRMrNEIG1OMZdLP3kH6kYn__v7by0w2ULXV3phr-Q6u#:~:text=Douglas%C2%AE%20Original%20Memory%20Foam%20Mattress,Year%20Warranty%20%E2%9C%93Free%20Sleep%20Bundle)).  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – top layer uses cooling gel-infused foam and a breathable cover to dissipate heat ([Douglas® Original Memory Foam Mattress | Canada's Best Mattress](https://www.douglas.ca/en/product/douglas-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOooj92nqjcRMrNEIG1OMZdLP3kH6kYn__v7by0w2ULXV3phr-Q6u#:~:text=Douglas%C2%AE%20Original%20Memory%20Foam%20Mattress,Year%20Warranty%20%E2%9C%93Free%20Sleep%20Bundle)). (Douglas incorporates a cryogel foam and moisture-wicking cover fibers to combat heat build-up.)  
- **Motion Isolation:** 5/5 – Very strong motion isolation. The memory foam comfort layer absorbs movement effectively; testers noticed only minimal motion transfer ([Douglas Mattress Review: Our Test Lab Ratings](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review#:~:text=Motion%20Isolation)). Great for light sleepers sharing a bed.  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Fair edge support for an all-foam bed. There is compression at the edges when sitting, as expected, and the perimeter feels less stable than a hybrid’s, though it’s slightly better than average for foam ([Douglas Mattress Review: Our Test Lab Ratings](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review#:~:text=Edge%20Support)) ([Douglas Mattress Review: Our Test Lab Ratings](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review#:~:text=The%20Douglas%20Mattress%2C%20like%20many,sleep%20right%20on%20the%20edge)).  
- **Price Range:** **Under $800** (Queen size ~CA$799) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=match%20at%20L369%20Price%20,Canada%20Image%3A%20%3F%20Image%3A)). Douglas is known as a high-value, budget-friendly Canadian-made mattress.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full/Double, Queen, King, California King (also Split King) ([Compare Mattresses | Douglas® ](https://www.douglas.ca/en/compare-mattresses/?srsltid=AfmBOopUXWlKl5_6FyZWk0FqfUU-AMn6a8dPH2AV_Xi3u67LSNN5bXUK#:~:text=match%20at%20L746%20Twin%20,California%20King%20%20Split%20King)). All common sizes are offered.  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Available exclusively online from Douglas/GoodMorning.com (no store retail presence). Ships across Canada with free delivery ([Douglas® Original Memory Foam Mattress | Canada's Best Mattress](https://www.douglas.ca/en/product/douglas-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOooj92nqjcRMrNEIG1OMZdLP3kH6kYn__v7by0w2ULXV3phr-Q6u#:~:text=Douglas%C2%AE%20Original%20Memory%20Foam%20Mattress,Year%20Warranty%20%E2%9C%93Free%20Sleep%20Bundle)).  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Noted for sleeping **cooler** than many memory foam beds (cool gel foam helps) ([Douglas Mattress Review (2025) | Best for Combo Sleepers?](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review/#:~:text=Douglas%20Mattress%20Review%20%282025%29%20,Who%20I%20don%27t)). Users and experts report **low motion transfer and good pressure relief**, making it good for couples ([Douglas Mattress Review (2025) | Best for Combo Sleepers?](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review/#:~:text=Douglas%20Mattress%20Review%20%282025%29%20,Who%20I%20don%27t)). It’s often praised for overall comfort and value given its affordable price. **Cons:** Edge support is only average ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=,average%20edge%20support)), and strict stomach sleepers or those who prefer a very bouncy bed might find it less suitable (foam has a slower response). Some sleepers who run very hot may still find it retains heat on warmer nights ([Douglas Mattress Review: Our Test Lab Ratings](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review#:~:text=Temperature%20Control)) ([Douglas Mattress Review: Our Test Lab Ratings](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review#:~:text=%E2%80%9CMemory%20foam%20absorbs%20body%20heat%2C,%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20Brad)).  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 365-night trial and a 15-year warranty (20 years if mattress is registered) ([Douglas® Original Memory Foam Mattress | Canada's Best Mattress](https://www.douglas.ca/en/product/douglas-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOooj92nqjcRMrNEIG1OMZdLP3kH6kYn__v7by0w2ULXV3phr-Q6u#:~:text=Douglas%C2%AE%20Original%20Memory%20Foam%20Mattress,Year%20Warranty%20%E2%9C%93Free%20Sleep%20Bundle)) ([Logan & Cove Review - Explore Reviews from the Top Sleep Experts](https://topsleeppicks.com/logan-and-cove-review/#:~:text=Logan%20%26%20Cove%20Review%20,a%20standard%20hybrid%20mattress)). Generous trial lets you test it for a full year; the warranty is longer than the standard 10 years, reflecting the manufacturer’s confidence.  

### Novosbed Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Comes in three firmness options – **Soft (approx. 4/10)**, **Medium (6/10)**, and **Firm (7-8/10)** ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,a%20significant%20improvement%20in%20sleep)). Novosbed also offers a free comfort adjustment kit to fine-tune firmness after purchase ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,a%20significant%20improvement%20in%20sleep)).  
- **Mattress Type:** Premium memory foam mattress (all-foam). It uses high-density memory foam layers for a more traditional memory foam feel (slow conforming hug).  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – features a breathable Tencel® cover and airflow foam layers, but no active cooling gels. Designed to sleep temperature-neutral for most (though memory foam can run warm for very hot sleepers).  
- **Motion Isolation:** 5/5 – Excellent. The dense memory foams virtually eliminate motion transfer. Both customers and expert tests note that movement from a partner is barely felt on Novosbed, making it ideal for couples.  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Average edge support. Like most memory foam beds, the edges compress under weight. You may feel some roll-off near the edge, especially in the Soft version, though the Firm version’s edges feel slightly more secure.  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (falls in the mid-to-high range for foam beds; Queen around $1,199 CAD before discounts) ([Silk & Snow Mattress Review (2025)](https://www.mattressnerd.com/silk-and-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Mattress%20Review,See%20our)). Often includes free pillows or promo deals.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full/Double, Queen, King, California King. (All standard sizes; split king achievable via Twin XL pairs.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold online by Novosbed (GoodMorning.com). Not available in physical stores;  shipped free across Canada.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Luxurious **high-density memory foam feel** – very pressure relieving and durable. Users praise its robust build and the option to adjust firmness (the Comfort+ kit) if it isn’t perfect initially ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,a%20significant%20improvement%20in%20sleep)). It’s often compared favorably to Tempur-Pedic at a lower cost. **Cons:** Can sleep a bit warmer than hybrids – some heat retention is noted, as with most memory foam. The **slow-response feel** means less bounce, so combo sleepers may find it harder to move around. Edge support is not as strong as innerspring hybrids, and the higher price point (relative to other online Canadian mattresses) is a consideration.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 120-night trial (which can be extended to ~180 nights with the adjustment kit process) and a 15-year warranty. The lengthy warranty and comfort guarantee reflect its premium status.  

### Silk & Snow Mattress (All-Foam)  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium, about 5–6/10. (Silk & Snow offers a **Medium (5)** feel by default; a Firm (7) option may also be available for those who need extra support ([Silk & Snow Mattress Review: Test Lab Ratings - Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-reviews/silk-and-snow-mattress-review#:~:text=Foundation%20www,7)).) Most sleepers find the standard model medium-firm, around 6/10 ([Douglas Mattress Review: Our Test Lab Ratings - Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review#:~:text=Douglas%20Mattress%20Review%3A%20Our%20Test,)).  
- **Mattress Type:** Memory foam mattress (three-layer all-foam design). It uses a gel-infused memory foam comfort layer atop high-density support foam.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – the top memory foam is gel-infused to draw heat away, and the cover is antimicrobial and breathable (infused with silver, which is primarily for cleanliness but also slightly cooler to the touch) ([Douglas® Original Memory Foam Mattress | Canada's Best Mattress](https://www.douglas.ca/en/product/douglas-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOooj92nqjcRMrNEIG1OMZdLP3kH6kYn__v7by0w2ULXV3phr-Q6u#:~:text=Douglas%C2%AE%20Original%20Memory%20Foam%20Mattress,Year%20Warranty%20%E2%9C%93Free%20Sleep%20Bundle)). Still, as an all-foam bed, it relies on those features to mitigate heat retention.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Very good. Owners report little to no motion transfer; the dense foam deadens movement well, which is a plus for couples. (The memory foam layer does an excellent job absorbing motion.) ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,helps%20in%20maintaining%20a%20neutral))  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Decent for a foam mattress. There is noticeable compression at the edges when sitting, and lying near the edge gives less support than the center. Overall edge support is acceptable but not a strong point, which is common for beds of this type ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,for%20both%20designs%2C%20but%20fewer)).  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (Queen size around ~$800–$900 CAD) ([Silk & Snow Mattress Review (2025)](https://www.mattressnerd.com/silk-and-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Mattress%20Review,See%20our)) ([Silk and Snow Mattress Review l Unbiased Assessment](https://realmattressreviews.com/silk-and-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=Silk%20and%20Snow%20Mattress%20Review,come%20in%20at%20%24750)). It’s considered an affordable option, often on sale below list price.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full/Double, Queen, King, California King. (All standard sizes; note the **Firm version** of this mattress, if offered, might have slightly different height.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold direct online via Silk & Snow’s website (Canadian company). Also available through select partners (e.g., some furniture stores or online marketplaces) – for example, EQ3 and others carry Silk & Snow mattresses ([Shop Silk & Snow Hybrid Mattress in Twin, Full, Queen, King - EQ3](https://www.eq3.com/us/en/product/ckyemx58q000038634hmelhmm/eq3plus/silk-and-snow/mattresses/silk-snow-hybrid-mattress?srsltid=AfmBOopqc__DQ85rnOfBTqqz2NMyUNZYMykb_mqj0qweWbrUYuB1MVK1#:~:text=Shop%20Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Hybrid,FedEx)).  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Noted for its **pressure relief** and comfort – side sleepers often find the Silk & Snow foam mattress relieves shoulder and hip pressure nicely. It’s also praised for being more affordable than big-name brands while delivering similar quality ([Silk & Snow Mattress Review (2025)](https://www.mattressnerd.com/silk-and-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Mattress%20Review,See%20our)). Motion isolation and overall comfort get high marks. **Cons:** Edge support and responsiveness are common drawbacks – some users feel the perimeter is weak ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,for%20both%20designs%2C%20but%20fewer)), and the foam can feel “too still” or hard to move on for combination sleepers. A few reviewers mention it felt firmer or softer than expected (break-in period might be needed) ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,mattress%20for%20its%20ability%20to)). Hot sleepers found it **retains some heat** on very warm nights, as memory foam tends to, despite the gel infusion ([Douglas Mattress Review: Our Test Lab Ratings](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/mattress-reviews/douglas-mattress-review#:~:text=Temperature%20Control)).  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night sleep trial (recently extended to 365 nights for new purchases) ([Silk & Snow Mattress Review (2025) - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-reviews/silk-and-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Mattress%20Review,out%20for%20100%20nights)) ([What is Your Return & Exchange Policy? - Silk & Snow](https://help.silkandsnow.com/hc/en-us/articles/14690636458004-What-is-Your-Return-Exchange-Policy#:~:text=What%20is%20Your%20Return%20%26,Our%20mattress%20toppers)), and a 15-year warranty ([Silk + Snow Mattress Review - Our Sleep Guide](https://www.oursleepguide.com/mattress/silk-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=This%20mattress%20is%20priced%20at,Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Mattress)). (Silk & Snow increased their trial to a full year in 2024, matching some competitors. Warranty is above industry standard 10 years, giving extra peace of mind.)  

### Polysleep Origin 2.0 Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium (about 5/10, optimized for pressure relief). Polysleep Origin 2.0 is designed slightly softer than medium to suit side sleepers, according to expert recommendations ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,top%20picks%20on%20our%20list)) ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,%E2%80%93%20Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Hybrid)).  
- **Mattress Type:** All-foam mattress. It uses a hybrid foam blend (proprietary polyfoam) for comfort over a high-density foam core. (No coils or latex; 100% foam construction.)  
- **Cooling Features:** Limited – **No special cooling technology** beyond an open-cell foam structure. It has a breathable cover, but no gel or phase-change material. It sleeps temperature-neutral for most, though some heat build-up is possible on hot nights (common for foam beds without cooling gel).  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Like most foam beds, it isolates motion well. User feedback indicates minimal disturbance when a partner moves, making it a **good budget choice for couples**.  
- **Edge Support:** 2/5 – Below average. The Origin is an entry-level 8–10″ foam mattress, which means the edges compress significantly under weight. Sleepers may feel less supported right at the edge compared to higher-end models that reinforce edges.  
- **Price Range:** **Under $800**. This is a value-priced mattress (Queen often around ~$600–$700 CAD). It’s positioned as an affordable option for budget-conscious shoppers.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full/Double, Queen, King (California King may not be offered in the Origin model).  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Available direct from Polysleep (online). Polysleep is a Canadian company; the Origin model is primarily sold through their website and sometimes on Amazon Canada.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Extremely **budget-friendly** while still being Canadian-made. Reports highlight its comfortable **pressure relief** for side sleepers – soft enough to cushion shoulders and hips. It’s also noted for low motion transfer given its all-foam build. **Cons:** Durability and support are a trade-off at this price – some users find it less supportive for heavier weights or long-term use (possible sagging over time). The simpler design means it lacks the “luxury” feel or advanced cooling of pricier beds. Edge support is a common complaint due to the thinner profile. Overall, it’s best suited as a guest bed, kid’s bed, or an affordable starter mattress rather than for those needing high support.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night trial; 10-year warranty. (Polysleep offers standard industry terms on their budget model. Full refund available within trial, and the warranty covers manufacturing defects.)  

### GhostBed Classic Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium-firm (around 7/10). The GhostBed Classic has a slightly firmer feel, providing a good level of support for back and stomach sleepers ([Douglas vs Endy Mattress Review (2025) - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-comparisons/douglas-vs-endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=Douglas%20vs%20Endy%20Mattress%20Review,support%20and%20pressure%20relief)).  
- **Mattress Type:** Mixed foam mattress (3 layers: 1.5” aerated latex-like foam, 2” gel-infused memory foam, 7.5” high-density polyfoam core). It’s an **all-foam bed** (no coils), but uses latex-synthetic foam on top for responsiveness ([Endy Hybrid Mattress Review - Chatelaine](https://chatelaine.com/home-decor/endy-hybrid-mattress-review/#:~:text=Endy%20Hybrid%20Mattress%20Review%20,free)).  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – a cooling cover and aerated latex foam layer for airflow, plus gel memory foam. It’s designed to sleep cooler than traditional memory foam. Many testers note it sleeps temperature-neutral; GhostBed markets it as a “cooling” mattress thanks to these materials ([Endy Hybrid Mattress Review - Chatelaine](https://chatelaine.com/home-decor/endy-hybrid-mattress-review/#:~:text=Endy%20Hybrid%20Mattress%20Review%20,free)).  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Good motion isolation. The memory foam layer absorbs most movement, so partners aren’t disturbed by tossing and turning. (There is a bit more bounce than a pure memory foam bed, due to the latex component, but it’s still dampened well.)  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Average edge support. The foam does compress at the edges; you might notice some dip sitting on the side ([Endy Mattress Review - Sleep Advisor](https://www.sleepadvisor.org/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=However%2C%20one%20thing%20to%20keep,have%20the%20best%20edge%20support)). However, users report they can still lie near the edge without feeling like they’ll roll off – it’s on par with other foam mattresses in this regard.  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (Queen ~$1,195 CAD regular price, often on sale for under $1,000). GhostBed is mid-priced; it’s more expensive than some Canadian competitors but often heavily discounted.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full/Double, Queen, King, California King (standard sizes; also Split King sets via two Twin XL).  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold online at GhostBed.ca and through retailers like Costco Canada (occasionally) and Amazon. GhostBed ships free in Canada, and some third-party sellers (Costco, etc.) carry it with their own return policies.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Known for a balance of **support and pressure relief** – the latex-like top gives it a bit of bounce and keeps sleepers “on” the bed more than “in” it, while the memory foam beneath provides contouring. This makes it a good fit for combination sleepers who change positions ([Douglas vs Endy Mattress Review (2025) - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-comparisons/douglas-vs-endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=I%20gave%20the%20Endy%20an,support%20and%20pressure%20relief)). It’s also praised for sleeping cooler than many all-foam beds due to the aerated latex and gel foam. **Cons:** Being slightly firmer, some side sleepers under ~150 lbs find it a bit too firm on shoulders. A few reviews mention a slight latex “rubbery” feel that not everyone loves (as opposed to a plush memory foam feel). Edge support is okay but not great. Initial off-gassing odor can last a few days after unboxing, which is noted by some users (common to foam beds).  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 101-night trial; 20-year limited warranty (first 10 years full replacement, years 11–20 pro-rated) ([GhostBed Bundles: Mattresses, Bed Frames & More](https://www.ghostbed.com/collections/bundles?srsltid=AfmBOorTrfosvrA6VzUaIHQQOw1oDpYZkhovlXEpxzbGwgSs0-IiRarQ#:~:text=GhostBed%20Bundles%3A%20Mattresses%2C%20Bed%20Frames,25%20year)) ([GhostBed Mattress Review (2025) | Expert Tested - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-reviews/ghostbed-mattress-review/#:~:text=GhostBed%20Mattress%20Review%20%282025%29%20,night%20sleep%20trial%20giving)). GhostBed’s trial is roughly 3+ months, and the warranty is longer than the standard, reflecting their confidence (the Luxe & higher models even have 25 years).  

### Nectar Memory Foam Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium-firm (about 6.5/10). Nectar is designed to hit a universally comfortable medium-firm feel. Many sleepers describe it as initially firm, then foam warms and adapts to medium-plush pressure relief.  
- **Mattress Type:** Gel Memory Foam mattress (all-foam, with a thick memory foam comfort layer over high-density polyfoam). It has that classic memory foam “hug.”  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – quilted poly-blend cover with cooling fibers, plus gel-infused memory foam. These are meant to draw heat away ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,mention%20it%20retains%20some%20heat)). However, memory foam inherently sleeps warmer; while Nectar’s cooling tech helps, very hot sleepers may still find it a bit warm.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 5/5 – Excellent. Motion transfer is minimal; the foam layers absorb movement so one partner’s motions are rarely felt by the other. This high motion isolation is frequently cited in reviews as a top benefit.  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Fair. The edges do compress under weight, as the mattress is all foam without reinforced edges. You may experience some roll-off if sitting or lying right on the edge, although most average-weight users find it acceptable when sleeping near the edge.  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (Queen often around $999 CAD, but Nectar heavily discounts – it can often be found for under $800 on promo). It’s positioned as a high-value bed-in-a-box, especially with included pillows or gifts.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King. (Standard sizes; no split king from Nectar directly, but two Twin XLs make a King adjustable setup.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Available through Nectar’s website (they have a Canada-specific site). Also sold on Amazon Canada and through some third-party online retailers. Nectar ships from distribution in North America with no additional duty for Canadian customers.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Extremely **pressure-relieving** – side sleepers often love how the Nectar’s thick memory foam layer contours to shoulders and hips, alleviating pressure points. It’s consistently rated highly for comfort in the **hips/back** for back sleepers too, as the foam fills in lumbar support. People also appreciate the **365-night trial and Lifetime “Forever” warranty** as part of the value. **Cons:** The memory foam feel means **less responsiveness** – some combination sleepers or those who dislike the “sinking” feeling may not prefer it. A common critique is that it can sleep a bit hot for those who run warm, since it has a deep conforming hug. Edge support is noted as a weak point by heavier individuals. There is also an initial foam odor that can take a week to fully dissipate (typical for this type of mattress).  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 365-night trial; Forever Lifetime warranty. Nectar’s trial is a full year, and if you keep it, they warranty against defects for as long as you own it (with no set end date) ([Noa Mattress Reviews (Pros and Cons for All Versions) - Sleepline](https://www.sleepline.com/noa-mattress-review/#:~:text=Noa%20Mattress%20Reviews%20,All%20of)). This is one of the most generous policies in the industry.  

### Puffy Mattress (Original)  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium (approximately 5.5–6/10). Puffy is engineered to feel medium to slightly medium-plush, aiming to accommodate most sleeper types. It has a slightly cloud-like soft feel on top with support underneath.  
- **Mattress Type:** Memory foam mattress (all-foam, with Cooling Cloud™ gel memory foam over a transition foam and firm support core). It’s 10” thick, classic 3-layer foam construction.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – the cover is a CoolingCloud™ cover that is cool-to-touch, and the memory foam is gel-infused to dissipate heat. Puffy markets itself as a cooler-sleeping foam bed, and most users find it doesn’t trap excessive heat. (It’s still foam, so it’s warmer than a coil bed, but the cooling tech is above average.)  
- **Motion Isolation:** 5/5 – Excellent motion isolation. Movement on one side is barely felt on the other, thanks to the thick memory foam layer. This is a strong suit for Puffy, often mentioned by couples.  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Average. The edges compress with pressure; the Puffy doesn’t have reinforced edges, so sitting on the edge will compress quite a bit. When lying near the edge, lighter individuals stay supported, but heavier folks might feel a slight roll-off sensation. It’s acceptable for most, but not a standout.  
- **Price Range:** $1,200–$2,000 (Queen MSRP around CA$1,749, but Puffy almost always has sales around  $1,150–$1,300). While the list price is high, the constant discounts put it in the mid-range cost category.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King. (All standard sizes; Puffy also has a **Lux** and **Royal** model in thicker profiles, but those are separate models.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold exclusively online via Puffy’s website in Canada. Puffy ships free to Canada (though some remote areas may have a surcharge). It’s not available in brick-and-mortar stores.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Often praised for its **“sleeping on a cloud” plush comfort**, especially by side sleepers and those with joint pain – it offers deep cushioning. It’s also known for very high customer satisfaction ratings, in part due to its generous trial and warranty. Many report improved sleep and pain relief on Puffy. **Cons:** The soft top layer means it may lack the support needed for some stomach sleepers or heavier-weight sleepers (they might prefer the firmer Puffy Lux or a hybrid version). A few reviewers mention that the mattress can feel too soft or have indentations over time for heavier individuals. Edge support and bounce are limited, so sitting on the edge or getting up can feel less stable.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 101-night trial; **Lifetime warranty**. Puffy allows returns after a 14-day break-in, for up to just over 3 months if it’s not a fit. The lifetime warranty covers indentations over 1.5″ and manufacturing flaws for as long as you own the mattress, which is a signature Puffy selling point (one of the few offering lifetime coverage).  

### Emma Original Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium-firm (around 6.5/10). Sleep testers rate the Emma Original as medium-firm – it strikes a balance with a slightly firm feel that softens as you settle in ([Endy Mattress Review: A Comfy Choice for Canadian Sleepers](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review#:~:text=)). It’s intended to be a one-firmness-fits-all mattress.  
- **Mattress Type:** All-foam memory foam mattress (3 layers: Airgocell foam, memory foam, and support foam). Emma uses a proprietary Airgocell® foam on top which is breathable and slightly responsive, over a contouring memory foam layer.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – the top layer is designed to be breathable and there’s a moisture-wicking cover. There’s no gel in the foam, but the open-cell structure of the Airgocell foam and the climate-regulating cover help with temperature control ([365-night Trial | Emma® Canada](https://emma-sleep.ca/pages/trial?srsltid=AfmBOorzz4vVPuZKp5oshnbo0cIQMhlifP6Ckj3nBhBnEV0uOCpqHxlx#:~:text=365,night%20trial%20for%20manufacture)). It performs about average in temperature neutrality for a foam bed – fine for most people, though very warm sleepers might find it slightly warm.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Very good. The memory foam layer works to isolate motion, so most sleepers won’t feel a partner’s movements. (There is a tiny bit of bounce from the top layer, but not enough to disturb – overall it’s quiet and absorbs motion well.) ([Polysleep vs. Zephyr Mattress Comparison - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/polysleep-vs-zephyr-mattress-comparison/#:~:text=All%20foam%20%E2%80%93%20Both%20beds,hybrid%20foams%2C%20and%20high))  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Typical for an all-foam design. The edges compress under significant weight. While lying down, the support is okay until you get right to the edge. People under ~200 lbs can use most of the surface without issues, but if you sit on the side or if you’re significantly heavier, you’ll notice the lack of a reinforced edge.  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (Queen around $1,000 CAD, often on sale for less) ([Best Mattress Canada - We Objectively Test 132+ Mattresses](https://naplab.com/best-mattress/best-mattress-canada/#:~:text=Best%20Mattress%20Canada%20,to%20read%20the%20full%20review)). Emma frequently offers promotions (50% off is common), bringing the price down considerably and making it a strong value buy.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full/Double, Queen, King, California King. (Emma offers all major sizes in Canada; the **Hybrid** versions may have slightly different offerings.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold online at Emma Sleep Canada’s website. Emma is a global brand (originating in Germany) and they ship free across Canada from local warehouses. In Canada it’s mostly online-only; you won’t typically find Emma in physical stores, though occasionally pop-up showrooms or events occur.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Noted for its **versatile comfort** – many back and side sleepers find the Emma Original comfortable, citing good pressure relief without excessive sinkage. It’s often highlighted as a top pick in Canada for its combination of support, motion isolation, and value ([Best Mattress Canada - We Objectively Test 132+ Mattresses](https://naplab.com/best-mattress/best-mattress-canada/#:~:text=Best%20Mattress%20Canada%20,to%20read%20the%20full%20review)). Reviewers like that it has a slightly bouncier feel on top than a pure memory foam (so it’s easier to move on), while still cushioning well. **Cons:** A few users expected it to be either softer or firmer – it lands in the middle, which might not please those looking for an extreme feel. Edge support is a recurring minor complaint. Also, because Emma often uses large discounts, some note the initial price is high if you miss a sale. In terms of heat, most are fine but a handful of very hot sleepers found it **warms up a bit overnight**, as there’s still a memory foam layer inside.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 365-night trial; 10-year warranty ([Mattress Warranty | Emma® Canada](https://emma-sleep.ca/pages/product-warranty?srsltid=AfmBOoqp_1Fv4myVDdYilFFYDHbK3lq0N8GW3je1GK9lIBb_d7EmeeG5#:~:text=%2AThe%2010,Night%20Trial%20Period%20exclusively)). Emma Canada gives a full year to try the mattress at home, with free pickup returns. The warranty is 10 years covering manufacturing and foam defects (standard for the industry).  

### Zinus Green Tea Memory Foam Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium (varies by thickness: e.g., the 6” and 8” versions are firmer, the 12” version feels softer medium-plush). The popular 12-inch Queen is about a medium to medium-soft feel, suitable for side and back sleepers.  
- **Mattress Type:** Memory foam mattress made in China. Uses multiple layers of CertiPUR-US certified foam (green tea-infused memory foam over transition foam and base foam). It’s an **all-foam budget mattress**.  
- **Cooling Features:** Minimal – infused with green tea and charcoal in the foam for freshness, but these do not actively cool. There is no gel layer or cooling cover. As a result, it can sleep warm for some people. It’s best for those who don’t tend to overheat, or to use in cooler climates/rooms.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Very good. Despite the low cost, it’s still memory foam, which excels at absorbing motion. Couples generally find that movements are isolated well (one of the strong points given its simple design) ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,for%20both%20designs%2C%20but%20fewer)).  
- **Edge Support:** 2/5 – Below average. The thinner models especially compress significantly at the edges. Even the thicker models have no reinforcement, so the edges are quite soft. Heavier individuals will experience deep sinkage sitting or lying on the edge. Many users only consider about 80% of the mattress’s width truly usable due to the weak edges.  
- **Price Range:** **Under $800** (often well under). For example, a Queen 12” is typically ~CA$500–$600 or less on Amazon. It’s one of the most affordable mattresses on the market ([Has anyone tried the Noa mattress? - Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mattress/comments/nyl1pj/has_anyone_tried_the_noa_mattress/#:~:text=Has%20anyone%20tried%20the%20Noa,and%20soft%20like%20I)).  
- **Sizes Available:** Narrow range of standard sizes – typically Twin, Full (Double), Queen, King. (Zinus often does **not** offer Twin XL or Cal King in their Amazon listings for these models).  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Widely available on **Amazon Canada**, Walmart, Wayfair, and other online retailers. Zinus is a popular Amazon “bed-in-a-box” brand known for easy shipping. It’s usually not found in brick-and-mortar stores in Canada.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Price is the biggest pro – it’s extremely affordable, making a new mattress accessible on a tight budget. Despite the cost, customers are often surprised by the **comfort for side sleeping** and overall pressure relief; it performs adequately for guests, kids, or temporary use. It’s also one of Amazon’s top-selling mattresses with thousands of reviews, indicating many find it comfortable and a great value. **Cons:** **Durability** is a concern – some owners report sagging or indentations within a couple of years (the foams are lower-density). It’s not ideal for heavier sleepers (they might bottom out or find it unsupportive). Also, it can have a strong “foam factory” odor on opening that takes days or even weeks to fully air out, according to reviews. Edge support and heat retention are common complaints in reviews, but often tolerated given the low cost.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** No formal trial period from Zinus, but depends on retailer – e.g., Amazon’s return policy (typically 30 days return) would apply. Warranty is 10 years limited from the manufacturer for defects ([Silk and Snow Mattress Review l Unbiased Assessment](https://realmattressreviews.com/silk-and-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=Silk%20and%20Snow%20Mattress%20Review,come%20in%20at%20%24750)). (Warranty service can require shipping the mattress back or other hurdles, which some users note can be challenging given the product’s low cost.)  

*_(Note: There are many other all-foam mattresses available in Canada beyond these highlights – including other budget brands like **Lucid**, **Spa Sensations**, **Nora**, etc., and luxury foams like **Tempur-Pedic**. Below, we cover Tempur-Pedic under innerspring/hybrid since many of their models now include coils.)_*

# Hybrid & Innerspring Mattresses (Canada)  

### Logan & Cove Hybrid Mattress (Choice & Frontier)  
- **Firmness Level:** Comes in two options. **Logan & Cove Choice:** Medium-Plush feel (~5.5/10, a bit softer than medium) ([Logan & Cove Choice vs Logan & Cove Frontier Mattress Comparison](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-comparisons/logan-and-cove-choice-vs-logan-and-cove-frontier-mattress-comparison/#:~:text=Comparison%20sleepopolis,C%241%2C299%2C%20C%241%2C499%20%3B%20California)). **Logan & Cove Frontier:** Medium-firm (closer to 7/10). Both deliver a balance of cushioning euro-top and supportive coils; Choice is geared more toward side/back sleepers, Frontier toward back/stomach sleepers needing more firmness.  
- **Mattress Type:** Luxury Pillow-top **Hybrid**. Multi-layer design with a quilted euro-top (gel-infused memory foam + polyfoam), transition micro-coils (Frontier model), and a pocketed coil core with edge support. It’s a true hybrid of foam and coils, offering a mix of contouring and bounce ([Logan & Cove Choice - Canada's Best Luxury Hybrid Mattress](https://www.loganandcove.ca/en/product/logan-and-cove-choice-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOorrckGpxl9wo1CgqyI0_JgMmrkdrDmbQAhdP-emc-JACMDFAP7o#:~:text=Mattress%20www.loganandcove.ca%20%20Canadian,night%20trial)).  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – Logan & Cove uses cooling gel foam in the pillow-top and breathable Tencel® fabric covers. The Frontier adds a layer of cooling nano-infused foam. Coupled with airflow through two coil layers (micro-coils in the pillow-top of Frontier, plus main coils), it sleeps quite cool ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=Temperature%20Neutrality)) ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=Our%20tests%20showed%20that%20the,other%20mattresses%20with%20foam%20layers)). Many reviewers find it temperature-neutral or cooler than all-foam beds.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 3/5 – Moderate. The foam layers absorb some movement, but the two layers of coils (especially in Frontier) add responsiveness, resulting in some bounce transfer ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=Motion%20Isolation)). Light sleepers who share a bed might feel a partner’s motions more than on an all-foam mattress. (It’s better than a traditional innerspring, but not as silent as memory foam.)  
- **Edge Support:** 4/5 – Strong. Reinforced perimeter coils and a sturdy build give excellent edge support ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=Edge%20Support)). Sleepers can utilize the full mattress area without feeling like they’ll roll off. In tests, there was little sinkage lying or sitting near the edge, especially on the Frontier (which has extra edge reinforcement) ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=Rating%3A%204%2F5)).  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (Choice model Queen is ~$999 CAD) and $1,200–$2,000 (Frontier Queen ~$1,299 CAD) ([Logan & Cove Choice vs Logan & Cove Frontier Mattress Comparison](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-comparisons/logan-and-cove-choice-vs-logan-and-cove-frontier-mattress-comparison/#:~:text=Comparison%20sleepopolis,C%241%2C299%2C%20C%241%2C499%20%3B%20California)). Logan & Cove is positioned as a **luxury at a lower price**; it’s significantly cheaper than comparable store-sold luxury hybrids.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full/Double, Queen, King, California King (both models). They even offer Split King (pair of Twin XL) for adjustable beds.  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Exclusively online via Logan & Cove/GoodMorning.com. Not sold in retail stores – it’s a direct-to-consumer product made in Canada ([Logan & Cove Choice - Canada's Best Luxury Hybrid Mattress](https://www.loganandcove.ca/en/product/logan-and-cove-choice-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOorBxIsUusPuMh2hCwce_N5iuXjQ0uVIen9m2fBo4XxWG-2YGrLb#:~:text=Mattress%20www,Warranty%20%C2%B7%20Made%20in%20Canada)). Delivery is free in most of Canada, with the mattress compressed in a box.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Frequently praised for its **high-end hotel luxury feel** at home. Sleepers love the plush, quilted pillow-top which provides cushioning, combined with the robust support of the coils – many note it alleviates back pain by keeping the spine aligned while still feeling plush on top ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=The%20Frontier%20Hybrid%E2%80%99s%20topmost%20layer,little%20to%20no%20pressure%20buildup)) ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=Our%20tests%20showed%20that%20the,other%20mattresses%20with%20foam%20layers)). It’s also noted for **quality construction** (heavier and more substantial than typical bed-in-a-box foam mattresses). Cooling performance and edge support are highlighted in expert tests as above-average ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=Temperature%20Neutrality)) ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=Edge%20Support)). **Cons:** The trade-off of two coil layers is **higher motion transfer** – some couples mention feeling their partner’s movements more than expected ([Logan & Cove Mattress Review: Canadian-Made, Sleeper Approved](https://sleepdoctor.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-mattress-review#:~:text=Motion%20Isolation)). The mattress is quite heavy and comes folded in a box, so setup may require two people. A few side sleepers under ~130 lbs found the Frontier version too firm (the Choice model is better for plushness). Also, the price is higher than all-foam options, though still a value against in-store brands.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 365-night trial; 15-year warranty ([365 Night Sleep Trial - Logan & Cove](https://www.loganandcove.ca/en/sleep-trial/?srsltid=AfmBOorb7Qi_WmI9upch9Oa5Z6RBkllFjThXhOJADeIREJjy2coN9pfa#:~:text=Try%20the%20Logan%20%26%20Cove,class%20customer%20care)) ([Logan & Cove Choice Review - 10 Data-Driven Tests - NapLab](https://naplab.com/mattress-reviews/logan-and-cove-choice-review/#:~:text=Logan%20%26%20Cove%20Choice%20Review,returns%20if%20the%20mattress)). Logan & Cove offers a full year to try it, with free returns. The warranty is a full 15 years covering manufacturing defects – a sign of confidence (many hybrids in stores have 10-year warranties).  

### Silk & Snow Hybrid Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium-firm (about 6.5/10). Designed to appeal broadly – it’s firm enough for back and stomach sleepers while still offering enough plushness on top for side sleepers ([The S&S Hybrid Mattress - Silk & Snow](https://www.silkandsnow.com/en-us/hybrid-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOoquwnG5AeNYWssevgBa5yPpZuyyYebYqYcUtXu9noS-nhuA9bAy#:~:text=The%20S%26S%20Hybrid%20Mattress%20,Sleep%20Bundle%20Included%20Alert)). Most users describe it as a true medium-firm with a good balance of softness and support.  
- **Mattress Type:** **Hybrid** (foam + coils). It has a quilted gel memory foam top layer, a transition polyfoam, and a pocketed coil core (with reinforced edges). Total height ~12”. This construction provides memory foam pressure relief with added support and airflow from the coils.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – the top layer is gel-infused memory foam to help with cooling, and the coils promote airflow. The cover also contains silver which is anti-microbial; while not specifically cooling, it’s breathable. Overall, it sleeps cooler than all-foam Silk & Snow due to the coils, and most don’t report overheating. (However, there’s still a memory foam layer, so extremely hot sleepers might find it warm on rare occasions.)  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Good for a hybrid. Thanks to the thick foam comfort layers, motion transfer is quite limited ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=match%20at%20L1204%20,helps%20in%20maintaining%20a%20neutral)). Couples generally find it isolates most typical movements, though as with any coil bed, a strong jolt can be felt more than it would on an all-foam mattress.  
- **Edge Support:** 4/5 – Very solid. The Silk & Snow Hybrid uses high-gauge coils around the perimeter for edge support. People report feeling secure even sitting on the edge, and you can sleep near the edge without significant sag. It performs much better on edges than the all-foam S&S mattress ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=transfer%20gets%20in%20and%20out,for%20both%20designs%2C%20but%20fewer)).  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (Queen usually around $1,000 CAD, often on sale near $850) ([The S&S Hybrid Mattress - Silk & Snow](https://www.silkandsnow.com/en-us/hybrid-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOoquwnG5AeNYWssevgBa5yPpZuyyYebYqYcUtXu9noS-nhuA9bAy#:~:text=The%20S%26S%20Hybrid%20Mattress%20,Sleep%20Bundle%20Included%20Alert)). It’s competitively priced for a hybrid, undercutting many retail-store hybrids.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King. (All standard sizes available for the hybrid model.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold through Silk & Snow’s website. Also available at select boutique furniture retailers and online marketplaces in Canada (e.g., EQ3 furniture stores list the S&S Hybrid, sometimes at the same prices) ([Shop Silk & Snow Hybrid Mattress in Twin, Full, Queen, King - EQ3](https://www.eq3.com/us/en/product/ckyemx58q000038634hmelhmm/eq3plus/silk-and-snow/mattresses/silk-snow-hybrid-mattress?srsltid=AfmBOopqc__DQ85rnOfBTqqz2NMyUNZYMykb_mqj0qweWbrUYuB1MVK1#:~:text=Shop%20Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Hybrid,FedEx)). Largely, it’s a direct-to-consumer product with free shipping Canada-wide.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Many side sleepers comment that this hybrid relieved their pressure points without being too soft – a tricky balance it manages well. **Spine support** is frequently praised; the zoned coils keep the body aligned, so users with back pain often report improvement. It’s also lauded for **quality materials** (e.g., the use of Canadian steel coils, a quilted cover, etc.) at a reasonable price. Edge support and ease of movement are noted positives by experts, making it friendly for sex and getting in/out of bed. **Cons:** A few people who prefer a very soft bed found it too firm (there is an **Organic model** S&S offers that is plusher). Conversely, a handful of heavier stomach sleepers thought it could be firmer – so extremely body-type-specific needs might not be 100% met. Motion isolation is good but not perfect; sensitive couples may notice occasional slight movements. As with any mattress containing memory foam, initial off-gassing smell can last a few days after unboxing (this is mentioned in some customer feedback).  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night trial (standard for Silk & Snow) ([Silk & Snow Mattress Review (2025) - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-reviews/silk-and-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Mattress%20Review,out%20for%20100%20nights)) ([Silk + Snow Mattress Review - Our Sleep Guide](https://www.oursleepguide.com/mattress/silk-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=Silk%20%2B%20Snow%20Mattress%20Review,has%20a%2015%20year%20warranty)); 15-year warranty ([Silk + Snow Mattress Review - Our Sleep Guide](https://www.oursleepguide.com/mattress/silk-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=This%20mattress%20is%20priced%20at,Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Mattress)). You can return or exchange within 100 nights if not satisfied (Silk & Snow covers return shipping). The 15-year warranty is above average, covering indentations over 1.5″ and manufacturing defects for a pro-rated 15-year term.  

### Silk & Snow Organic Mattress (Latex Hybrid)  
- **Firmness Level:** Two firmness options – **Firm (approx. 8/10)** for back/stomach sleepers, or **Medium** (Plush) option (~6/10) for side sleepers ([The S&S Organic Mattress - Silk & Snow](https://www.silkandsnow.com/en-us/organic-mattress/?srsltid=AfmBOooTTrJ38R8df7lPB1tr7Rc3cZQ1mC4kY0qPiIfVyMr1_u_-QxiZ#:~:text=The%20S%26S%20Organic%20Mattress%20,%3B%20Plush%20%28%2B)). This model allows customers to choose firmness by selecting the appropriate topper: the Medium-Plush adds a latex pillow-top layer for more softness, whereas the Firm configuration omits it or uses a firmer latex layer.  
- **Mattress Type:** **Latex Hybrid**. Made with natural and organic materials: organic cotton cover, wool fire barrier, multiple layers of Dunlop latex (instead of foams), and pocketed steel coils (zoned for support). It’s a hybrid since it combines latex and coils; no synthetic foams are used.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – excellent cooling by design. Latex is naturally breathable and doesn’t trap heat like memory foam. The cotton/wool cover wicks moisture and helps regulate temperature. The coil core allows plenty of airflow. Many consider latex hybrids like this to be among the coolest-sleeping mattress types. (Both firmness versions sleep cool; wool also provides a bit of temperature buffering, keeping it cool in summer and warm in winter.)  
- **Motion Isolation:** 3/5 – Moderate. Latex is more buoyant than memory foam, so motion transfer is a bit higher. However, the individually pocketed coils and the dense latex do localize movement better than old-fashioned innersprings. Light sleepers may feel some partner movement, but most find it acceptable unless extremely sensitive.  
- **Edge Support:** 5/5 – Excellent. The robust steel coil unit and firmer latex around the edges give this mattress outstanding edge support. Even in the plush configuration, the edges hold up very well when sitting or lying. Sleepers can utilize the full surface confidently – a noted strong point in expert reviews.  
- **Price Range:** $1,200–$2,000 (Queen around $1,600 CAD for medium, slightly less for firm). It’s pricier due to organic materials. Often there’s an extra charge for the plush topper option. This is in the higher-end segment, though still often cheaper than comparable store-sold latex hybrids.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King. (All standard sizes; no split king option from S&S, but two Twin XL can serve as one.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold through Silk & Snow’s website. Being a niche product, it’s less commonly found via third parties, but some eco-focused retailers might showcase it. Primarily, it’s direct-to-consumer with delivery across Canada.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Those seeking **natural and chemical-free** materials love this mattress – it has certifications for organic content (latex, cotton, wool). The latex provides a **responsive, uplifted feel** – sleepers often mention they feel more “on” the mattress (easy to move), which is great for combination sleepers and sex. Back and stomach sleepers in particular rave about the support from the firmer latex and zoned coils; it keeps the hips from sinking and the spine aligned. The cooling and breathability are often highlighted – many hot sleepers report this bed stays comfortably cool. **Cons:** The feel of latex is not for everyone – some side sleepers used to memory foam miss that deep hug (even the medium/plush version is more buoyant and has a gentle cradle rather than a deep sink). Motion isolation, while decent, is not as good as a full memory foam bed – couples with very different schedules might notice movements more. Price is a barrier for some; it’s a more significant investment. Also, latex mattresses are heavy and a bit rigid, so moving or rotating the mattress can be challenging without help.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night trial; 15-year warranty ([Silk + Snow Mattress Review - Our Sleep Guide](https://www.oursleepguide.com/mattress/silk-snow-mattress-review/#:~:text=This%20mattress%20is%20priced%20at,Silk%20%26%20Snow%20Mattress)). Silk & Snow’s standard policies apply – you can test it at home and return if it’s not a fit (they often require a 30-night minimum trial before return, to allow adjustment). The warranty covers latex and coil defects; 15 years is above the 10-year industry norm, reflecting the durability of latex (it tends to have a long lifespan).  

### Casper Original (Foam & Hybrid)  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium (around 6–7/10). Casper’s original mattress is generally felt as medium-firm by most (Sleepopolis rates it ~6.5/10, a true medium-firm ([Douglas vs Endy Mattress Review (2025) - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-comparisons/douglas-vs-endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=Douglas%20vs%20Endy%20Mattress%20Review,support%20and%20pressure%20relief))). It has a zoned construction, feeling softer under shoulders and firmer under hips, which can make it feel medium-soft for side sleepers and medium-firm for back sleepers in those areas.  
- **Mattress Type:** Available in **All-Foam or Hybrid** versions. The construction is a triple-layer design: a perforated breathable foam on top, a zoned memory foam layer in the middle, and a support base (either high-density foam in the all-foam model, or pocketed coils in the Hybrid model). The Hybrid version offers more bounce and edge support, while the Foam version offers slightly better motion isolation.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – features Casper’s AirScape™ breathable foam on top with thousands of perforations to increase airflow ([Best Mattress Canada (2025) | Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/best-mattress/best-mattress-canada/#:~:text=Our%20Top%20Pick%20for%20the,Best%20Mattress%20Canada)). The cover is also moisture-wicking. These features help it sleep cooler than older memory foam beds. The hybrid’s coils further improve airflow. Overall, Casper sleeps temperature neutral for most people; very hot sleepers might still want the Snow upgrade (Casper’s cooling tech variant), but the standard model performs well in cooling for its class.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Very good, especially the all-foam version. Casper’s foams absorb motion effectively, and testers often note minimal motion transfer when one person moves. The Hybrid will transmit a touch more bounce from the coils, but still dampens a lot of movement due to the foam layers. It’s a strong performer for couples (only a slight step behind pure memory foam beds).  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 (Foam) to 4/5 (Hybrid) – The all-foam Casper has okay edge support; you’ll notice some sinkage sitting on the edge due to lack of reinforced perimeter ([Casper Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/casper-mattress-review/#:~:text=Firmness%3A4,8%20%2F%2010)). The Hybrid version adds firmer edge coils, giving much better edge stability – you can sit or lie near the edge with more support. Casper specifically improved edge support in hybrids to help people get in and out of bed without that “sliding off” feeling ([Casper Mattress | Bed In a Box | In-Store or Online - Sleep Country](https://en.sleepcountry.ca/products/the-casper-mattress.html#:~:text=Casper%20Mattress%20,signature%20comfort%20at%20a)).  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (Queen foam around $1,095 CAD; Hybrid a few hundred more) ([Endy Mattress Review (2025) | Engineer Tested in Canada ](https://www.mattress-reviews.com/mattress-reviews/endy-mattress-review/#:~:text=delivered%20to%20customers%20in%20a,995%2B%20CAD)). Casper often runs promos. It’s mid-priced: not the cheapest, but accessible for a widely-known brand. (In retail stores like Sleep Country, a queen Casper Original is often listed around $1,300, with sales bringing it closer to ~$1k) ([Casper Mattress | Bed In a Box | In-Store or Online - Sleep Country](https://en.sleepcountry.ca/products/the-casper-mattress.html#:~:text=Casper%20Mattress%20,signature%20comfort%20at%20a)) ([Endy vs Casper Mattress Comparison (2025) - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-comparisons/endy-vs-casper/#:~:text=Prices%20listed%20are%20before%20discount,XL%2C%20%24700%20CAD%2C%20%24995%20CAD)).  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full (Double), Queen, King, California King. All standard sizes available in both foam and hybrid. (Additionally, Casper offers other models: **Nova Hybrid** and **Wave Hybrid**, with different feels and higher prices.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Casper is widely available. You can buy online at Casper’s website (casper.ca for Canada) with direct shipping. It’s also sold through Amazon, and through brick-and-mortar retailers: Sleep Country Canada carries Casper in-store, and Costco Canada occasionally carries select Casper models or bundles ([Casper Mattress | Bed In a Box | In-Store or Online - Sleep Country](https://en.sleepcountry.ca/products/the-casper-mattress.html#:~:text=Casper%20Mattress%20,signature%20comfort%20at%20a)). Casper has a few of its own showroom stores in North America, but in Canada partnerships like Indigo or EQ3 have showcased Casper products too.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Casper’s zoned support design is praised – it feels softer under the shoulder area and firmer under the hip/lumbar, which many testers say **improves spinal alignment** and comfort, especially for side and back sleepers ([Best Mattress Canada (2025) | Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/best-mattress/best-mattress-canada/#:~:text=Our%20Top%20Pick%20for%20the,Best%20Mattress%20Canada)). It’s often called out for its balanced feel: a bit of bounce, a bit of contour – **“universally comfortable”** for many sleeping positions. Quality and customer service (100-night trial, easy returns) bolster its reputation. **Cons:** Some sleepers who prefer very plush or very firm mattresses find Casper too middling – it doesn’t have an extreme feel. A few side sleepers still find it a tad firm on shoulders (despite zoning) if they are lighter weight. There have been occasional reports of the Casper sagging after several years – durability for very heavy users might be a concern (the company has updated materials over time to address this). Also, Casper is pricier than some Canadian startups; you pay a bit for the brand name. Off-gassing is mild and usually clears in a day, but a slight “new foam” smell is noted at unboxing by some.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night trial; 10-year limited warranty ([Mattress Warranty | Emma® Canada](https://emma-sleep.ca/pages/product-warranty?srsltid=AfmBOoqp_1Fv4myVDdYilFFYDHbK3lq0N8GW3je1GK9lIBb_d7EmeeG5#:~:text=%2AThe%2010,Night%20Trial%20Period%20exclusively)). Casper offers a standard 100-night risk-free trial with full refund and pickup. The warranty covers manufacturing defects and lasting indentations over 1″ for 10 years. (Casper also provides an option to return if purchased via Sleep Country or other retailers, typically through that retailer’s return policy – e.g., Sleep Country’s comfort exchange.)  

### Casper Nova Hybrid Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium-Soft (around 5/10). The Nova Hybrid is Casper’s plushest mattress; it has a much softer, more enveloping top feel compared to the Original. Sleepers describe it as gentle and pressure-relieving, especially good for side sleepers who want extra softness.  
- **Mattress Type:** Premium **Hybrid**. It has multiple foam layers (including AirScape™ perforated foam and zoned ergonomic foam) over pocketed coils. The Nova features 3 zones of support with softer foam at shoulders and firmer foam around hips, similar in idea to the Original but with a plusher overall execution.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – like other Caspers, it has AirScape perforated foam for airflow and a breathable cover. It also comes in a **Nova Hybrid Snow** version which adds Phase Change Material and other cooling tech for those who want maximum cooling. The standard Nova Hybrid sleeps on the cooler side of average for a plush bed; most don’t overheat on it thanks to the airflow and coils, but very warm sleepers might consider the Snow upgrade.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Despite the softness, it still isolates motion well. The thick foam layers on top soak up movement, so couples can sleep with minimal disturbance. The coils are pocketed and not overly bouncy, so the Nova remains pretty motion-deadening. Only extremely light sleepers might sense faint movements.  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Good but not great. The Nova is softer and doesn’t have as robust edge reinforcement as the Original Hybrid or Wave. You’ll notice compression at the edges due to the plush top layers. Casper did wrap the coils with firm foam edges, but the extreme plush upper layers negate some of that when sitting. When lying down, edges feel secure enough for most, but heavy individuals might feel the perimeter softness.  
- **Price Range:** $1,200–$2,000 (Queen Nova Hybrid ~CA$1,995 regular price). It’s a high-end model; one of Casper’s more expensive offerings. Sales can sometimes bring it closer to ~$1,600-$1,700. The Snow version adds a few hundred on top.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King (Nova comes in all standard sizes, Hybrid only – Casper doesn’t make a Nova all-foam).  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold on Casper’s site and through select retailers (e.g., Sleep Country also carries the Nova Hybrid, often by special order). It’s not as commonly stocked as the Original, but you can find it online easily. Free White Glove delivery might be offered on this higher-end model in some regions.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Side sleepers in particular love the Nova Hybrid – it’s frequently noted for **exceptional pressure relief**; shoulders and hips sink in comfortably, reducing numbness or pain for side sleepers who found the Original too firm. It still maintains support beneath the hips due to zoning, so people report it feels plush yet supportive in the right areas. The materials feel premium (luxurious cover, thicker profile). **Cons:** Not ideal for stomach sleepers or those who need a firm bed – some users mention their back bowing if they sleep face down due to the softness. The higher price is a barrier; some feel the improvement in comfort doesn’t justify nearly double the cost of the Original. Also, a few reviews mention that because it’s softer, **long-term durability** could be a concern (so far, most feedback is positive on comfort, but the model is newer so less long-term data). As with Casper Original, some off-gassing occurs initially.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night trial; 10-year warranty (same standard Casper policy). You can try the Nova at home and return if it’s not a fit. Warranty covers the usual defects for 10 years.  

### Casper Wave Hybrid Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium (around 6/10). The Wave Hybrid has a balanced medium feel – not too firm, not too soft, aiming for a luxury feel that supports and cradles equally. It’s slightly softer than the Original but firmer than the Nova.  
- **Mattress Type:** **Hybrid** with advanced zoned support. The Wave is Casper’s flagship, with 5 layers: breathable foams, gel pods and memory foam in the middle for ergonomic zoning, and pocketed coils. It has unique gel polymer “pods” in the foam layer under the waist/lower back for extra support where needed. This makes it one of the more technologically complex hybrids on the market.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – multiple. It has AirScape™ foams with cooling gel infusions, plus a Latex foam layer (which naturally stays cool) just above the coils. Additionally, the Wave comes in a “Snow” version that adds continuous Phase Change cooling bands. The standard Wave Hybrid already sleeps fairly cool for a foam-heavy mattress due to the latex, cooling gels, and coils. Hot sleepers generally fare well, especially if opting for the Snow upgrade which is specifically aimed at hot sleepers.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Good. The Wave’s foam layers, especially the memory foam and latex combo, do a solid job containing motion. There is some bounce from the coils and latex, but it’s dampened. Couples typically report restful sleep, with maybe minor detectable movement if someone is very light-sensitive.  
- **Edge Support:** 4/5 – Very good. Casper reinforced the Wave’s edges knowing it’s a thicker, luxury bed. The robust coil base and firm border foam let the edges support sitting and lying better than Casper’s cheaper models. There’s still a bit of top-layer softness, but overall users feel secure on the edge, and in testing the Wave’s edge support scored well for a hybrid.  
- **Price Range:** **$2,000+** (Queen Wave Hybrid is about CA$2,995 regular; often on sale around $2,400). This is a premium-priced mattress competing with high-end brands. The Snow upgrade adds roughly $500. It’s one of the most expensive mainstream bed-in-a-box options.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King. (All standard; Casper often promotes the Twin XL Wave for those wanting a high-end split king setup.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Available via Casper’s site, and select retailers like Sleep Country (usually by order). Given its high price, Casper sometimes includes in-home setup. It’s not commonly stocked on showroom floors except Casper’s own showrooms, but you can order it sight-unseen to try at home due to the trial.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** The Wave Hybrid is frequently lauded for its **exceptional support**, especially for those with back pain. The gel pods and zoning really shine – many users with back or hip issues report reduced pain and better alignment. It manages to feel **cushioning yet supportive** in a way that justifies its cost for some. The materials (latex, gels, quality coils) give it a very premium, durable feel. It also sleeps cooler than the Original and Nova, which is a pro for warm sleepers wanting a Casper. **Cons:** The price is the biggest hurdle – some reviewers who love the mattress still mention it’s only “worth it” if you truly need the advanced features. A few side sleepers actually found it a tad firm (the zoning gives more support, which if you’re lighter, can feel firmer especially under shoulders). It’s heavy and awkward to move due to thickness and integrated gels. Given it’s a complex design, a couple of users noted concerns about potential issues (though covered by warranty, the fear of something like gel pods shifting is mentioned, albeit rarely). Overall negative feedback is limited, but those who didn’t absolutely love it often cite that a much cheaper mattress could also work nearly as well for them.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night trial; 10-year warranty. Same Casper policy – you have about 3 months to decide if the Wave improves your sleep enough to warrant the cost. The warranty covers indentations and defects; given the Wave’s premium components, Casper stands by the standard 10-year period (no extended warranty beyond that, despite the higher price).  

### Purple Mattress (Original & Hybrids)  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium-firm feel with a unique adaptive quality. The **Original Purple** (foam base) feels around 6.5/10 – it’s firm under light pressure but softer under heavier parts of the body (the Hyper-Elastic Polymer grid flexes to accommodate weight). This means it can feel firm at first touch, then medium to medium-soft when you lie down and the grid buckles. The **Purple Hybrid** models: *Purple Hybrid* (~7/10 a bit firmer due to coils and thinner grid), *Purple Hybrid Premier 3* (~6/10), and *Premier 4* (~5/10, the plushest) — the number corresponds to grid thickness in inches, with thicker grid = softer feel.  
- **Mattress Type:** Uses Purple’s **proprietary Hyper-Elastic Polymer grid** atop either foam (Original) or coils (Hybrids). The Purple grid is a gel-like elastic polymer in a square grid pattern that provides pressure relief and support. The Original Purple is 2” grid on foam (classified as foam mattress, though not memory foam), and Purple Hybrids are 2” or 3” or 4” grid on a pocketed coil core (so those are true hybrids). This construction is unlike memory foam or latex; it’s its own category, often just termed “Purple Grid mattress.”  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – **excellent cooling** inherently. The Purple grid has open air channels throughout, which allows airflow right under the sleeper ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,helps%20in%20maintaining%20a%20neutral)). The material itself doesn’t retain heat; it’s temperature neutral. Covers are breathable and some models have cooling cover options. Overall, Purple mattresses are known for sleeping very cool – a top choice for hot sleepers. Even the Hybrid Premier 4 (with the thickest grid and foam layers) outperforms most foam beds in cooling due to massive airflow through the grid.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 3/5 – Moderate. The Original Purple (foam base) does a decent job isolating motion; the polymer grid isolates some movement, but it’s also somewhat bouncy. The Hybrid Purples with coils will transfer a bit more motion than all-foam beds. Generally, there is a **responsive bounce** to the Purple material – if one person is very active, the other may feel a mild jiggle. It’s not as motion-dead as memory foam, but many couples find it acceptable unless one is extremely sensitive.  
- **Edge Support:** 2/5 (Original) to 4/5 (Hybrids) – The **Original Purple’s edge support is a weak point**; the foam perimeter isn’t especially reinforced and the grid can collapse more at the edge, so people often feel significant dip near the sides. The **Hybrid models** added a dense foam border around the grid and coils, dramatically improving edge support. On Hybrid Purples, you can sit or lie near the edge with much more stability – users report feeling secure even on the smaller Queen size edges. So, edge support is poor on the all-foam Purple, but very good on the newer hybrids due to design improvements.  
- **Price Range:** $1,200–$2,000 for Original (Queen ~ $1,799 CAD), **$2,000+** for Hybrids (Queen Purple Hybrid ~$2,299; Premier 3 ~$2,999; Premier 4 ~$3,799 CAD). Purple is a premium brand and the unique tech comes at a higher cost. They occasionally have promotions (like free pillows or sheets) rather than big discounts.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin XL, Full (for Original), Queen, King, Cal King, Split King. (*Note:* The Original Purple is not made in Twin or Cal King in some cases; it often starts at Twin XL. Hybrids typically start at Twin XL as well. Purple prioritizes Twin XL so two can make a Split King). No standard Twin for the Purple due to how the grid is manufactured (Twin XL is their smallest).  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Purple can be bought online (purple.com ships to Canada with duties included). In Canada, distribution is more limited – there aren’t Purple stores, but some partnerships exist (e.g., Sleep Country **does not** carry Purple as of now; however, some independent mattress stores or online platforms might import them). Many Canadians order directly from Purple online. The company uses a 3rd-party to handle international shipping. It’s also available on Amazon.com but not always on Amazon.ca. So, most availability is direct online order.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Purple’s standout feature is **pressure relief without heat or sink**. Side sleepers with pain issues often rave about how the Purple grid eliminates pressure on shoulders and hips – it’s very pressure adaptive, almost “floaty.” At the same time, it’s more supportive and cool than memory foam. Many who try everything for cool sleep find Purple to be one of the coolest options due to its airflow. The durability of the hyper-elastic polymer is also praised – it doesn’t form body impressions easily. **Cons:** The feel is **very different** – not everyone likes the squishy, gel-like feel of the grid. It’s often described as sleeping on a giant waffle or jelly-like surface; some get used to it in a week, others never do. Motion isolation is not as good as Tempur-type beds, so some couples prefer more traditional foam. The Original’s edge support and somewhat trampoline feel can be off-putting (many felt compelled to upgrade to a hybrid for those reasons). Price is high, and returning a Purple (while within trial you can) is a bit more logistical work due to weight. Also, the polymer can be **temperature sensitive** in cold climates – it gets firmer in cold rooms until it warms up from body heat, so if your bedroom is very cold (below ~15°C) initially the bed can feel extra firm.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night trial; 10-year warranty. Purple honors a standard trial in Canada with full refund if returned (they often arrange a local charity pickup for returns). Warranty covers failures of the grid or foam border for 10 years. The polymer is heavy-duty, so issues are rare; the warranty requires proper foundation support. (Purple also has an optional extended warranty program for purchase, but generally the 10-year is standard included.)  

### GhostBed Flex Hybrid Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium (about 6.5/10). The GhostBed Flex has a cushiony top with a medium firmness – intended to feel comfortable for a wide range of sleepers. It’s a touch softer than the GhostBed Classic, due to the plush quilted cover and foam layers, but overall lands around true medium.  
- **Mattress Type:** **Hybrid** (foam + coils). It’s 13” thick with a quilted cooling fiber cover, 2 layers of gel memory foam, a transition layer, and an 8.5” pocketed coil core with reinforced edges. It blends the slow conforming feel of memory foam on top with the support and bounce of coils underneath.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – the cover is GhostBed’s proprietary cooling fabric with fiber (cool-to-touch), and the foam layers are gel-infused and arranged to promote airflow. The coils further help with breathability. GhostBed specifically markets the Flex as a cooling mattress, and many reviewers confirm it sleeps temperature neutral or cool. There’s minimal heat trapping thanks to the combination of cooling materials and airflow channels.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Good for a hybrid. The multiple memory foam layers on top of the coils do a commendable job minimizing motion transfer. During sleep, most couples won’t notice each other’s light movements. Only more pronounced movements (like jumping into bed) produce some bounce that can be felt. Overall, it’s better than a traditional innerspring for motion isolation, and just slightly behind all-foam beds – a nice middle ground.  
- **Edge Support:** 4/5 – Strong. The GhostBed Flex has reinforced edges (larger coils or higher density foam encasement around the perimeter). Users report that the edges feel secure for sleeping and sitting – very little sag. In fact, edge support is often highlighted in reviews; you can tie your shoes sitting on the bed without it collapsing much, and two people can comfortably share a Queen without feeling they’ll roll off at the sides.  
- **Price Range:** $1,200–$2,000 (Queen around CA$1,750 list, but frequently on sale for ~$1,300–$1,400). It’s in the mid-to-upper range for bed-in-a-box hybrids. GhostBed often includes pillows or discounts, making the effective price lower.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, California King (all standard sizes). GhostBed also sells a Split King bundle (two Twin XLs) for adjustable bases.  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold on GhostBed’s website (Canada) and also through **Costco Canada** (the Flex is sometimes offered in Costco’s online assortment), as well as a few other online retailers. GhostBed tends to have its own online presence, but partnerships with large retailers like Costco indicate confidence in the product (and you can leverage Costco’s return policy if bought there).  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** People often comment that the Flex hits a sweet spot of **“floating” feeling – supportive, yet with a nice soft cushion top**. Side sleepers get pressure relief from the memory foam layers, while back sleepers appreciate the sturdy coil support. Many reviews mention **sleeping cool** on the Flex; the cooling cover and gels seem to work as advertised, which is a big plus for those who had issues with hot all-foam beds. Couples like the combination of decent motion isolation and strong edges – it’s easy to spread out on this mattress. **Cons:** A few stomach sleepers over ~230 lbs felt the Flex was a tad soft (their hips could sink slightly), so extremely firm preference folks might need a firmer model or the GhostBed Classic. Initial odor is noted by some (as with most boxed hybrids, it can have a “new mattress smell” that dissipates in a few days). Also, the GhostBed Flex is heavy and a bit unwieldy to move or rotate. Lastly, while the price on sale is good, the regular price is high – some customers only found it worth it with a substantial discount or as a Costco deal.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 101-night trial; 25-year limited warranty ([Shop GhostBed: Luxury Cooling Mattresses & Bedding | GhostBed®](https://www.ghostbed.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopfhfNfW6zC7fUCAL-ypeK1di5dOLh3UeaDEaPpIAwi5x4FSmbd#:~:text=Shop%20GhostBed%3A%20Luxury%20Cooling%20Mattresses,returns%20%26%20easy%20online%20shopping)) ([GhostBed Mattress Review (2025) | Expert Tested - Sleepopolis](https://sleepopolis.com/mattress-reviews/ghostbed-mattress-review/#:~:text=GhostBed%20Mattress%20Review%20%282025%29%20,night%20sleep%20trial%20giving)). GhostBed offers the same 101-night trial on the Flex. The warranty is one of the longest in the industry: 25 years (first 10 years full replacement, years 11–25 pro-rated). This covers manufacturing defects or deep indentations. They require using a proper foundation for warranty validity.  

### Sealy Posturepedic Innerspring Mattress (Hybrid Models)  
- **Firmness Level:** Varies by model – the Posturepedic line comes in a range from **Plush** Euro-top to **Medium** to **Firm**. A common model (e.g., “Posturepedic Plus Medium Euro-top”) will feel around medium (5.5–6/10), while the firm tight-top versions can be 7.5/10. Sealy uses comfort naming (Plush, Cushion Firm, Firm, etc.) in different retailer-exclusive models, but generally offers options to suit different preferences.  
- **Mattress Type:** **Innerspring / Hybrid.** Traditional Posturepedic mattresses are innerspring-based, often with a foam pillow-top. Newer Posturepedic **“Plus” or “Hybrid”** models include a layer of gel memory foam on top of an advanced coil system (Response Pro HD or similar). So depending on exact model: it could be an all-innerspring (coil + pillow top), or a hybrid (significant foam layers over coils). Common traits: Zoned support coils (with reinforced center third for lumbar support) and a stable edge system.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – many Posturepedic models feature cooling covers (SealyCool or Chill™ technology with phase change material) and gel-infused foams on the comfort layers ([Brand Name Mattresses in Canada – Mattress Mattress](https://mattressmattress.com/collections/mattresses?srsltid=AfmBOoq4CMPy_S0-Bd2vUNItOXgv78x7nuppKG3-QEX3FB7cDRthi0ZI#:~:text=Beautyrest%C2%AE%2C%20Dreams%20to%20Go%C2%AE%2C%20iComfort%C2%AE%2C,Pedic%C2%AE)). Innerspring construction also allows airflow. The result is generally a cool sleep experience; the surfaces are engineered to not trap much heat. For example, models with SealyCool Gel Memory Foam and breathable border fabric help keep temperatures regulated. (Heavily pillow-topped models might sleep a bit warmer due to more foam, but still cooler than a pure memory foam bed.)  
- **Motion Isolation:** 3/5 – Moderate. Individually pocketed coils in higher-end Posturepedics do reduce motion transfer compared to old continuous coil designs. The addition of memory foam in hybrid versions further dampens motion. Still, these beds have some bounce, so you may feel a partner’s larger movements. It’s often rated as “acceptable” for couples – not as isolating as all-foam, but better than traditional innersprings.  
- **Edge Support:** 5/5 – Excellent. A hallmark of Sealy Posturepedic is the **DuraFlex™ edge system**: a reinforced foam encasement around the coil perimeter. Users consistently find they can sit or lie on the edge without significant sag. This strong edge support is great for making the mattress feel larger and for stability when getting in and out of bed. Even plush Euro-top models tend to have sturdy edges underneath the pillow-top foam.  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 for mid-range Posturepedic (Queen size). Premium Posturepedic Plus or Hybrid models can go $1,200–$2,000. For example, a Queen Sealy Posturepedic Euro-top might retail around $1,099, with frequent sales dropping it below $1k. There are also basic Posturepedic models often under $800 during promotions.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full/Double, Queen, King, California King. (All standard sizes; also occasionally “Double XL” or other odd sizes via certain retailers, but mostly standard.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Widely available at mattress stores and furniture retailers across Canada: **Sleep Country**, The Brick, Leon’s, Hudson’s Bay, and regional stores all carry Sealy Posturepedic lines (often under model names unique to each retailer). They can also be bought online through those retailers’ websites (some offering White Glove delivery). Sealy’s direct site often directs you to retailers. Costco sometimes has Sealy mattresses (occasionally a Posturepedic model in a bundle).  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** The Posturepedic series is known for **reliable support and durability**. Many customers have owned one for 8–10+ years and report good longevity. The zoned coil support (with a reinforced middle) is often mentioned as helping with back support – a lot of back sleepers find Posturepedic hits the right balance of comfort and support. The edge support is a standout; couples enjoy being able to use the full bed area. Also, since there are many models, consumers appreciate the ability to choose a comfort level (plush vs firm) that suits their taste. **Cons:** Being a spring mattress, it may not contour as precisely as a memory foam bed – some side sleepers with very sharp pressure points might prefer more foam. Motion transfer, while improved, can still be felt at times – light sleepers sometimes mention feeling partners or pets moving. Quality can vary by specific model; lower-end Posturepedics might develop indentations if heavily used (so it’s worth investing in the higher coil count models for longevity). Additionally, some people find the initial **odor from the foam layers** in new hybrid models (a slight chemical smell) which usually fades in days. Overall, negatives tend to be individual preference mismatches (too firm/too soft), which is why testing in store or using the exchange policy is common.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** **Trial period** depends on retailer – typically 90 to 120-night comfort exchange at major stores (Sleep Country offers a 100-night exchange for example). **Warranty:** 10-year limited warranty from Sealy. This covers manufacturing defects or significant sag (usually >1.5″ indentation) ([Brand Name Mattresses in Canada – Mattress Mattress](https://mattressmattress.com/collections/mattresses?srsltid=AfmBOoq4CMPy_S0-Bd2vUNItOXgv78x7nuppKG3-QEX3FB7cDRthi0ZI#:~:text=Beautyrest%C2%AE%2C%20Dreams%20to%20Go%C2%AE%2C%20iComfort%C2%AE%2C,Pedic%C2%AE)). Warranty service is handled through the retailer or Sealy, and generally requires proper foundation use.  

### Serta iComfort Mattress (Foam and Hybrid models)  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium to Medium-Firm (varies by specific model). The all-foam iComfort models (e.g., iComfort CF2000) tend to be medium-firm ~6.5/10. Plush options are around 5/10, and firm options can be 7-8/10. The iComfort line has multiple models; some with pillow-tops are softer, whereas firm tight-top models are quite firm.  
- **Mattress Type:** **Memory Foam and Hybrid** options. Serta’s iComfort is a line of cooling memory foam mattresses. Some are pure foam constructions (thick layers of gel memory foam and support foam), and others are iComfort Hybrids which pair the foam layers with an advanced coil support core. All use Serta’s EverCool Fuze gel memory foams, and some models include carbon fiber or graphite infusions for extra cooling and support.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – **notable cooling technology**. iComfort was one of the first mainstream lines to heavily feature cooling in memory foam. They incorporate materials like **Carbon Fiber Memory Foam** (which conducts heat away and adds support) and **gel-infused foams** ([Brand Name Mattresses in Canada – Mattress Mattress](https://mattressmattress.com/collections/mattresses?srsltid=AfmBOoq4CMPy_S0-Bd2vUNItOXgv78x7nuppKG3-QEX3FB7cDRthi0ZI#:~:text=Beautyrest%C2%AE%2C%20Dreams%20to%20Go%C2%AE%2C%20iComfort%C2%AE%2C,Pedic%C2%AE)). High-end models even have phase-change material covers (CoolTouch). The result: iComfort beds are designed to sleep cooler than traditional memory foam. Many users and tests confirm they do sleep **comparatively cool for foam**, though hybrids will sleep cooler than the all-foam versions thanks to coil airflow.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 5/5 (Foam) and 4/5 (Hybrid) – Excellent. The all-foam iComforts have outstanding motion isolation, as expected from memory foam. Even the hybrids, with individually wrapped coils and thick foam layers, isolate motion very well – couples usually find disturbances minimal. Serta often markets iComfort for couples for this reason.  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 (Foam) and 4/5 (Hybrid) – The foam iComfort mattresses have just average edge support; the edges compress under sitting pressure like most foam beds, though some models use a slightly denser foam edge. The iComfort Hybrids, however, use Serta’s BestEdge® foam encasement, giving a sturdier edge. On those, edge support is quite solid for sitting and sleeping (close to Posturepedic levels). So edge support depends on the sub-model – pure foam ones are not particularly strong at the edges.  
- **Price Range:** $1,200–$2,000 for most. Queen sizes in the iComfort line often hover around $1,499 to $1,999 (hybrids at the higher end). Serta positions iComfort as their top tier (above Perfect Sleeper), so prices are premium, though frequent retailer sales can drop them by several hundred dollars. For instance, a mid-range iComfort on sale might be ~$1,299 Queen.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King. (All standard sizes, and some retailers carry Split King sets in hybrid form.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Available through major retailers like Sleep Country, The Brick, Hudson’s Bay, etc. Serta iComfort is widely distributed in mattress stores across Canada. You can also buy from retailer websites. Serta’s own site will direct to local sellers; they typically are not sold D2C online. Costco Canada occasionally has a Serta foam mattress but usually a lower line, not iComfort.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Owners often comment that iComfort lives up to its **name in pressure relief** – the memory foam layers do a great job cushioning joints and contours. It’s a top pick for those with arthritis or side sleepers needing cradling. The **cooling** aspect gets positive feedback; many who had issues on older memory foam found the iComfort notably cooler or at least not heat-trapping. The hybrid models get love for combining that comfort with a bit more support and edge integrity. **Cons:** Some people who are not used to memory foam’s feel might find the slow-response sensation of iComfort beds to be a bit restricting or hard to move on (the “quicksand” feel, especially in plush versions). A minority of users still find them warm (if they run extremely hot, even gel foams might not be enough). The price is high, so expectations are high – a few negative reviews cite that over time (after several years) body impressions can form, which, if under the warranty threshold, can be frustrating. Also, because Serta refreshes the iComfort line periodically, replacement under warranty sometimes might not match the original feel exactly. Overall, satisfaction is high, but shoppers should ensure the chosen firmness is right, as exchanging can involve some effort with retailer policies.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** Trial depends on retailer (typically 90-120 nights through the retailer’s exchange program). Warranty is 10-year limited from Serta, standard for the industry. Serta will cover indentations greater than 0.75″ for iComfort (since they use high-density foam, their warranty has a stricter threshold in some models, check specific warranty card). Process is usually via retailer inspection.  

### Beautyrest Black Hybrid Mattress  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium-firm (approximately 7/10) in its standard configuration. The Beautyrest Black line offers a **luxury firm feel** by default, with pillow-top plush variants available that bring it down to around medium (5.5-6). The base Black Hybrid without a pillow-top is on the firmer side of medium-firm, intended to be supportive and slightly contouring.  
- **Mattress Type:** **Hybrid** (premium pocketed coils + memory foam comfort layers). Beautyrest Black is Simmons’ top-of-the-line, featuring their T3 pocketed coil technology (triple strand coils for extra support) and multiple layers of high-density memory foam and polyfoam. Some models include latex or RightTemp™ memory foam (infused with carbon for cooling and support). The Black models are essentially luxury hybrids with thick profiles (~13″ to 15″ depending on pillow top).  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – Beautyrest Black mattresses incorporate cooling in several ways: BlackICE™ 4.0 system (cool-to-touch cover materials, silk-air fiber layers, and conductive memory foams). Some versions have phase-change material in the cover. The foams like RightTemp memory foam use conductive materials to move heat. As a result, the Black sleeps cooler than older Beautyrests; it’s designed for temperature management. Still, very plush pillow-top versions will have a lot of foam, which can run slightly warm for the hottest sleepers, but overall it’s considered a cooling-friendly luxury mattress.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Good. The pocketed coils in the Beautyrest Black are individually wrapped and do a nice job containing motion, and the generous foam layers absorb most vibrations. Most couples find motion transfer is minimal – definitely better than traditional mattresses. Only in bounce-intensive scenarios (e.g. someone jumping out of bed) would there be noticeable movement. It strikes a balance: not “dead” like an all-foam Tempur, but quiet enough for almost all sleepers.  
- **Edge Support:** 5/5 – Excellent. Beautyrest Black has a robust foam encasement around the coil unit, and the mattress is built to commercial luxury standards (hotels often use them), so edge support is a priority. You can utilize the entire surface; the edge feels firm and stable even when sitting. This is frequently highlighted in both expert tests and user feedback – edge support is essentially as good as it gets for a hybrid.  
- **Price Range:** **$2,000+**. Queen sizes typically start around $2,699 and go up (pillow top versions can exceed $3,000). It’s a high-investment mattress. Retailers often have sales (e.g., $500 off), but it remains in the premium price bracket. King versions can be $3k–$4k. Financing is commonly used given the cost.  
- **Sizes Available:** Queen, King, California King primarily. (Some models may be available in Twin XL or Full by special order, but Beautyrest Black is usually marketed in larger sizes; lower Beautyrest lines cover Twin/Full. Hotels sometimes get custom sizes in Black.) In consumer retail, Queen and above are most common.  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold in-store at higher-end mattress retailers and department stores (The Bay, some Sleep Country locations, boutique sleep stores). Also available online via those retailers’ sites and sometimes direct from Beautyrest’s Canadian site. Due to the expense, many prefer to try in person. Simmons does not compress Beautyrest Black for shipping – these are typically delivered flat by white-glove delivery given their build and weight.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** A frequent comment is **“hotel bed at home”** – Beautyrest Black is known for its plush yet supportive feel that many 5-star hotels use. The combination of substantial memory foam and strong support coils yields excellent pressure relief without sacrificing support. Many people with back issues mention that the Black provided them the firm support they need while still feeling luxuriously comfortable on top. The aesthetics and build quality also impress; it’s a thick, well-crafted mattress that feels premium in every detail. **Cons:** Price is a major con – it’s a significant investment and out of range for many budgets. Some users also report that the mattress is extremely heavy, making it difficult to move or adjust (even rotating seasonally can be a two-person job). For those who chose a pillow-top ultra plush version, a few found it too soft over time (impressions can form in the pillow top if not rotated, as with any thick pillow-top). There are occasional reports of slight depressions forming after a few years – given the cost, customers are very sensitive to this (warranty will cover if beyond 1.5″ indent). Another minor con: the very firm base feel of the standard Black (no pillow top) can be too firm for lightweight side sleepers – it’s targeted at average to heavier folks or back/stomach sleepers unless you get the plush top.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** Trial depends on retailer (generally 100-night exchange offered by the store if any). Warranty is 10-year manufacturer warranty from Simmons. Given the in-home delivery nature, returns are usually done via exchange rather than simply returning for refund (unless bought from a generous return policy retailer). The 10-year warranty covers manufacturing defects or deep impressions; due to the high-end nature, Simmons tends to honor valid claims and sometimes may offer a repair or replacement. It’s crucial to have a sturdy foundation or frame to support this heavy mattress to keep warranty valid.  

### Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-Adapt (Medium Hybrid)  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium (6/10). The TEMPUR-Adapt Medium Hybrid is Tempur-Pedic’s baseline hybrid model, designed to have a medium feel that balances the famous Tempur “slow sink” with slightly more support and ease of movement from coils. Sleepers describe it as initially firm-ish but slowly adapting to the body and feeling medium. (Tempur also offers Soft and Firm versions in higher models, but the Adapt Medium is their flagship feel.)  
- **Mattress Type:** **Hybrid** (Tempur memory foam + pocketed coils). It has a premium knit cooling cover, a layer of TEMPUR-ES comfort memory foam, a layer of Original TEMPUR support foam, and a spring coil unit. Tempur-Pedic is known for very high-density foams, so even with coils, this is a substantial mattress that contours deeply. The hybrid version adds coil support and more airflow versus the all-foam Tempur-Adapt.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – improved over classic Tempurs. The cover uses a Cool-To-Touch technology (phase-change material) in the Adapt line. The hybrid’s coils also allow more air circulation than an all-foam Tempur. However, Tempur-Pedic memory foam is dense and can still retain heat; the Adapt is **more cooling than older Tempur models**, but some very hot sleepers might prefer the upgraded PRObreeze/LUXEbreeze lines. Generally, the Adapt Medium Hybrid sleeps neutral to slightly warm, depending on the person – many report it’s comfortable temperature-wise, especially the hybrid, but a few find they need cooling bedding to complement it.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 5/5 – Excellent. Tempur-Pedic is the gold standard for motion absorption, and even with coils, the Adapt Hybrid isolates motion extremely well. The pocketed coils are individually wrapped and the thick Tempur foam layers on top absorb energy. Couples frequently mention that one person can get up or move and the other hardly feels it. It’s one of the best options for light sleepers concerned about partner movements. ([Best Mattress in Canada: Expert Picks and Lab-Tested Reviews](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/best-mattress/best-mattress-in-canada#:~:text=,dissipate%20within%20a%20few%20days))  
- **Edge Support:** 3/5 – Fair to Good. The Adapt Hybrid has foam encasement around the coil edge, but memory foam is so soft that edges will compress when sitting. It’s better than older all-foam Tempurs (which were notorious for edge roll-off), yet still not as firm at the edge as some other hybrids. When lying down, most people feel supported near the edge because the coils provide push-back; you won’t roll off. But if you frequently sit on the edge or have two people sleeping right to the edge of a Queen, you might notice a bit of dip compared to say, a Beautyrest or Posturepedic edge.  
- **Price Range:** **$2,000+**. Tempur-Pedic is a premium brand. The TEMPUR-Adapt Medium Hybrid Queen is around $2,799 CAD MSRP. Often, promotions or “bundle with adjustable base” deals can effectively lower cost (e.g., $300 gift with purchase, etc.), but Tempur rarely has deep discounts. The higher Adapt (Pro, Luxe) go well above $3k. So this is a top-tier price category.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin XL, Full (Double), Queen, King, Split King, Cal King (Split Cal King as well). (*Note:* Tempur-Pedic doesn’t usually offer Twin in their higher models, but Twin XL is offered for pairing in splits. Queen is the smallest most retailers carry in store for Tempur-Adapt Hybrid.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Sold at **Sleep Country Canada**, The Brick, Leon’s, and other major bedding retailers. Tempur-Pedic also has its own showrooms in some areas and an official Canadian website that sometimes allows direct purchase (with White Glove delivery). Typically, purchase includes in-home setup due to weight. You won’t find Tempur-Pedic compressed in a small box – it’s delivered flat. Some online marketplaces (like Amazon) list Tempur mattresses via third-party sellers, but best to go through authorized dealers for warranty assurance.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Tempur-Pedic owners often become very loyal – the **pressure relief** of Tempur foam is second to none. Side sleepers with severe pressure points or back pain sufferers frequently report that Tempur Adapt mattresses significantly improved their sleep quality, with **personalized contouring** that distributes weight evenly. The hybrid version makes it a bit easier to move and get out of bed compared to classic Tempur foam, which older customers or combination sleepers appreciate. Motion isolation is commonly praised – “can’t feel my spouse at all” is a recurring theme. Also, durability: many report their Tempur mattresses last well beyond 10 years with proper care, maintaining performance. **Cons:** The feel of Tempur foam is not for everyone – it’s very **slow responding**. Some people feel “stuck” or find it effortful to switch positions because the foam molds around you. This can be off-putting to those used to springier beds. The price is frequently mentioned; while many say it’s worth it for the pain relief, others can’t justify it and might return it due to cost vs. benefit. Heat retention, while improved, is noted by a subset of users – if you sleep very hot, even the Adapt might not be cool enough (Tempur’s solution would be upselling to the PRObreeze which is cooler). Edge support is middling – a large person sitting might compress a lot, which some noticed with daily use (like sitting to put on socks). There’s also a break-in period: initially the mattress can feel firmer, taking a few weeks to “loosen up”, and the odor of the Tempur material can linger for several days after unwrapping, which sensitive noses might dislike.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** Typically 90-night trial (depending on retailer; Sleep Country, for instance, has a 100-night exchange for Tempur-Pedic, but not a refund). Tempur-Pedic’s direct policy is usually a 90-night trial if bought from them, with return options. **Warranty:** 10-year full replacement warranty from Tempur-Pedic. They require a proper foundation and have standards for indent depth (usually ~0.75″ allowable before it’s considered a defect, reflecting the foam’s quality). Tempur’s customer service is generally good at handling issues, though warranty claims on such an expensive item often undergo scrutiny (inspections, etc.).  

### Saatva Classic Mattress (Luxury Innerspring)  
- **Firmness Level:** Comes in 3 choices – **Plush Soft (~3-4/10)**, **Luxury Firm (~6/10)**, and **Firm (~8/10)**. The Luxury Firm is the most popular, designed to feel medium-firm and accommodating for most sleepers. Plush Soft has extra cushioning for side sleepers who want a softer feel, and Firm is quite firm, ideal for stomach sleepers or those who prefer an **very firm** sleep surface.  
- **Mattress Type:** **Innerspring (coil-on-coil) with Euro Pillow-Top**. The Saatva Classic is a double-coil unit: an upper layer of micro-coils (or a steel coil unit) paired with a lower hourglass coil base (steel coils that are interconnected). It also has a quilted Euro-top with memory foam and fiber fill for comfort. It’s not a bed-in-a-box; it’s a traditional mattress with modern enhancements delivered ready-to-use. Overall, it’s a hybrid of sorts (foam + two layers of coils), but often categorized as a luxury innerspring.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – mainly via airflow. There’s no special gel or phase-change tech, but the considerable airflow through two coil layers and breathable organic cotton cover keeps it cool. The pillow-top uses foam, but it’s not so thick as to trap too much heat. Most sleepers find Saatva Classic sleeps cool or at least neutral, given the innerspring design. (If anything, the Plush Soft might sleep a tad warmer than the Firm because more of your body is hugged by foams, but generally it’s a good mattress for temperature regulation.)  
- **Motion Isolation:** 3/5 – Moderate. Because Saatva uses some interconnected coils (in the base unit), there is a bit more motion transfer than in fully pocketed coil designs. The memory foam layer in the lumbar zone and the individually wrapped micro-coils on top do absorb some movement, so it’s better than old two-sided innersprings. However, couples will feel large movements more than on a pocketed coil or foam bed. If one is a light sleeper and the other tosses frequently, it could be noticeable. Saatva prioritizes responsiveness and support over absolute motion isolation.  
- **Edge Support:** 5/5 – Excellent. It has a dedicated foam encasement around the edges. Users often comment they feel very stable on the edges – no roll-off. This, combined with two coil layers, means you can sit or lie on the edge and still feel fully supported. It’s designed for maximal usable sleep surface, appealing for couples or anyone who likes to spread out.  
- **Price Range:** $1,200–$2,000 (Queen at $1,795 CAD approximately, often with included delivery). Saatva positions itself as “affordable luxury” – significantly cheaper than in-store luxury mattresses like Stearns & Foster, yet more expensive than compressed bed-in-a-box brands. The price includes White Glove delivery in Canada, which adds value. King is around $2,195 CAD. They also frequently have sales of ~$200 off.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King, and even Split King or Split Cal King. (Saatva caters to custom setups and even offers unusual sizes by request, though standard ones are common.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Saatva is online-only (direct-to-consumer). In Canada, they deliver to most regions (with some remote area surcharges). You won’t find Saatva in physical stores; instead, you order on their website and they manufacture and deliver from regional distribution (some in the U.S. close to the border). Delivery includes setup of the new mattress and removal of the old one.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Saatva Classic often gets praise for its **balanced feel** – the Euro-top gives cushioning and the dual coils give robust support. Many back pain sufferers mention improvement due to the strong lumbar support (it has an extra lumbar memory foam pad) and the option to choose a proper firmness. The Luxury Firm is a crowd-pleaser for combination sleepers, offering both comfort and support. Its **hotel-like finish** and quality (organic cotton, hand-tufted Euro-top) make it feel very premium. Additionally, people appreciate not having to set it up (White Glove) and that it’s not roll-packed, so it’s ready to sleep on immediately with no off-gassing odors. **Cons:** The flip side of its traditional design is that it’s heavier and can be tricky to move if needed. Some couples who are extremely motion-sensitive might prefer a bed with individually pocketed coils or foam – a few reviews note that you can feel some partner movement on Saatva, especially if on the lighter side or if the bed is on a wood floor without a carpet (amplifies vibration). Plush Soft can be too soft for some (leading to body impressions if the sleeper is heavy – though Saatva will often work with customers on exchanges for a different firmness). A small number of users expected more “hug” and were disappointed that it feels more on top of the mattress (these were typically memory foam loyalists trying innerspring). Also, returning it (if not satisfied) means coordinating a pickup – Saatva does honor its 365-night return policy, but a $99 transport fee is deducted in Canada, which a handful of customers have mentioned.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 365-night trial; 15-year warranty. Saatva has one of the longest trials in the industry – you can sleep on it for a full year. If you return, they refund minus a $99 pickup fee (in Canada, similar to U.S.). They also allow exchanges for a different firmness during the trial (with the same $99 fee). The warranty is 15 years; for the first 2 years, they’ll replace the mattress for free if defective. Years 3-15 are repaired & re-covered at a handling cost, or Saatva offers the alternative of a “Fairness Replacement Option” where you keep the original and get a new Saatva at a discounted price depending on years of ownership ([Logan & Cove Review - Explore Reviews from the Top Sleep Experts](https://topsleeppicks.com/logan-and-cove-review/#:~:text=Logan%20%26%20Cove%20Review%20,a%20standard%20hybrid%20mattress)). Overall, their customer service is well-rated for responsiveness during the trial and warranty processes.  

### Helix Midnight (Customizable Hybrid Series)  
- **Firmness Level:** Medium (about 6/10). Helix Midnight is the most popular model of Helix’s line, designed as a medium feel for side sleepers and most people. Helix offers a range from Soft (Moonlight, Sunset ~4/10) to Medium (Midnight, Dusk ~6/10) to Firm (Twilight, Dawn ~7-8/10). The Midnight hits a true medium – not too soft, not too firm, with a leaning towards pressure relief for side sleepers.  
- **Mattress Type:** **Hybrid** (Memory foam/polyfoam comfort layers + pocketed coil core). Each Helix model uses a combination of foams (some models have memory foam, others dynamic poly foam) over an 8” pocket coil system with reinforced perimeter. The Midnight specifically has a memory plus polyfoam comfort system for a balanced contouring feel. Helix mattresses are known for tailoring models to sleep position and firmness preferences, but structurally all are similar hybrids with different foam densities/ILDs.  
- **Cooling Features:** Yes – while not laden with tech, Helix hybrids sleep fairly cool. The coils allow airflow, and the cover is a soft knit designed for breathability (you can optionally upgrade to a Helix **“GlacioTex” Cooling Cover** for added cooling). The foams are Polyfoam and polyurethane-based memory foam that are light enough not to overheat significantly, and they don’t have a deep hug like Tempur foam. Overall, users find Helix sleeps neutral. The upgraded cooling cover is recommended for very hot sleepers, otherwise the standard configuration suffices for most without notable heat issues.  
- **Motion Isolation:** 4/5 – Good. The individually wrapped coils and the foam top layers do isolate most motion. Helix Midnight, having memory foam, actually does slightly better in motion isolation than the models without memory foam. Couples generally are satisfied – normal movements are dampened. Only a heavy disturbance (like jumping or an active pet) might produce minor felt motion. It’s comparable to other medium-firm hybrids in this regard.  
- **Edge Support:** 4/5 – Strong. Helix uses reinforced coils along the edges, so edge support is notably solid for sitting and lying. You won’t feel like you’ll slide off – a perk often mentioned in reviews. It may not be quite as iron-clad as a high-end Beautyrest or Saatva, but it’s above average and maximizes sleeping surface on a smaller bed.  
- **Price Range:** $800–$1,200 (Queen Helix Midnight ~USD $1,099 which is roughly $1,400 CAD, but Helix often has sales $100-200 off, and frequently bundles pillows or sheets). With currency conversion and any shipping to Canada, it ends up around that range. Helix is a **mid-range priced hybrid** – cheaper than in-store brands, more expensive than basic foam mattresses. Shipping to Canada is an extra cost (often ~$150) unless a promotion covers it, which effectively nudges it toward the higher end of that range.  
- **Sizes Available:** Twin, Twin XL, Full, Queen, King, Cal King. (All standard sizes; Helix also offers a Split King by sending two Twin XL, commonly for their adjustable base setups.)  
- **Retailers & Online Availability:** Primarily sold online through Helix’s own website. Helix does ship to Canada (with a fee). They occasionally appear on Amazon, but warranty is best ensured via direct purchase. There’s no physical Helix store in Canada, though they have a showroom in NYC and some pop-ups. They rely on their 100-night sleep trial for customers to test the feel.  
- **Customer & Expert Reviews:** **Pros:** Helix’s big draw is **personalization** – customers like that they could take a sleep quiz or choose a model tailored to their sleeping style and firmness preference, which increases the chance of getting a comfortable match. The Midnight specifically is loved by many side sleepers and couples because it offers that contouring memory foam feel on top with the support of coils – best of both worlds. Many remark on **lower back pain relief** and comfort in side sleeping after switching to the Midnight. The ability to upgrade with a cooling cover or to a Luxe version (with zoned coils and a pillow top) is also a plus for those wanting extra features. **Cons:** Some customers found the standard Helix to be a bit basic in terms of luxury feel – it doesn’t have a thick euro-top or the heavy, sumptuous feel of more expensive hybrids. A few users expected more “plushness” and ended up exchanging for the softer model or upgrading to the Luxe. There are scattered reports of durability issues like indentations after a few years, especially from heavier individuals on softer models (the Midnight, being medium, fares better in durability feedback). Also, since it’s an online brand, warranty claims or exchanges require dealing with support remotely – a handful of people found this process cumbersome (e.g., taking photos to prove sagging). Another minor point: the initial odor from the mattress (it’s CertiPUR-US certified, but like all foam, there’s a new smell) took a few days to dissipate, as noted by sensitive noses.  
- **Trial Period & Warranty:** 100-night trial; 10-year warranty (15-year for Luxe models). Helix’s trial is standard – if not a fit, they arrange a return or swap within ~30 to 100 nights. The 10-year limited warranty covers defects like abnormal sag (>1″) or manufacturing issues. They require using a proper base (slatted or platform). Helix is known to be customer-friendly with exchanges (they might send a softer or firmer topper if you’re just slightly unhappy, as a first remedy). The warranty is pretty typical; the Luxe models (which cost more) come with longer 15-year coverage due to their upgraded components.

**Additional Notes:** *The above list highlights many of the prominent mattresses available in Canada across various categories and price points. Nearly all come with risk-free trial periods (generally 100 nights or more) and at least a 10-year warranty, ensuring customers can test comfort compatibility and have long-term protection. When mapping a user’s needs (from a questionnaire) to these mattresses, consider:* **firmness preference**, **desired mattress type**, **sleep temperature**, **motion isolation needs (for couples)**, **edge support importance (for those who sit on or share the bed)**, **budget range**, **size requirement**, **purchase channel preference (online vs. store)**, and any **specific concerns (like back pain, materials, etc.)**. *This structured dataset can be used to filter and match the optimal mattress based on those user inputs, using the fields provided for each mattress model.*
