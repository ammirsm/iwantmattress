## How to Use These Closed-Ended Responses

1. **Compare Answers**: Review each item side by side with your partner to see where you agree (e.g., both want Medium-Firm) or differ (e.g., one needs plush, the other needs firm).  
2. **Identify Patterns**:  
   - If you both marked “neck/shoulder pain” (Q11) and prefer plush (Q3=A), consider a **pressure-relieving memory foam or plush hybrid**.  
   - If you both have lower back pain but chose firmer (Q3=C or D), look into a **medium-firm or firm hybrid/innerspring** for better lumbar support.  
3. **Budget vs. Comfort**: If pain relief is a priority, answers to Q9 and Q9a can guide whether a higher-end or specialized mattress is worth it.  
4. **Check for Special Features**:  
   - **Allergies** (Q7) → Look for hypoallergenic or low-off-gassing models.  
   - **Motion Isolation** (Q6) → Foam or hybrid with thick comfort layers.  
   - **Cooling** (Q5) → Mattresses with cooling gels, breathable covers, or latex hybrids.  
5. **Decide on a Final List**: Based on your combined checklist, shortlist 2–3 mattress types or brands. Check warranties, in-home trials, and return policies—especially if you have chronic pain.

This **check-mark style** questionnaire should help you and your partner quickly pinpoint shared needs and pain-related preferences—without open-ended answers. Good luck in finding a mattress that supports both of you comfortably!
